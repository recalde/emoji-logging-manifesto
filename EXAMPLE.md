# Emoji Logging Examples

This file demonstrates how emoji logging can be implemented in various languages including Python, Bash, and C#. These examples showcase how simple visual enhancements can make logs more readable and intuitive.

---

## 🐍 Python Example

```python
import time

start = time.time()

# Emoji-enhanced logs
print("☁️  " + f"[{time.time() - start:05.2f}] Creating AWS Secret...")
time.sleep(1)

print("⏳  " + f"[{time.time() - start:05.2f}] Waiting for pods to become ready...")
time.sleep(2)

print("🧙  " + f"[{time.time() - start:05.2f}] Validating pods with AI magic...")
time.sleep(1.5)

print("✅  " + f"[{time.time() - start:05.2f}] All 48 pods joined the cluster successfully!")
time.sleep(0.5)

print("🚀  " + f"[{time.time() - start:05.2f}] Deployment complete!")
```

## 🐚 Bash Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash

start=$(date +%s.%N)

log() {
  local emoji=$1
  shift
  local message="$@"
  local now=$(date +%s.%N)
  local elapsed=$(echo "$now - $start" | bc)
  printf "%s  [%.2f] %s\n" "$emoji" "$elapsed" "$message"
}

log "☁️"  "Creating AWS Secret..."
sleep 1

log "⏳"  "Waiting for pods to become ready..."
sleep 2

log "🧙"  "Validating pods with AI magic..."
sleep 1.5

log "✅"  "All 48 pods joined the cluster successfully!"
sleep 0.5

log "🚀"  "Deployment complete!"
```

---

## 💻 C# Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Threading;

class EmojiLogger
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();

        Console.WriteLine("☁️  [" + stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds.ToString("00.00") + "] Creating AWS Secret...");
        Thread.Sleep(1000);

        Console.WriteLine("⏳  [" + stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds.ToString("00.00") + "] Waiting for pods to become ready...");
        Thread.Sleep(2000);

        Console.WriteLine("🧙  [" + stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds.ToString("00.00") + "] Validating pods with AI magic...");
        Thread.Sleep(1500);

        Console.WriteLine("✅  [" + stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds.ToString("00.00") + "] All 48 pods joined the cluster successfully!");
        Thread.Sleep(500);

        Console.WriteLine("🚀  [" + stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds.ToString("00.00") + "] Deployment complete!");
    }
}
```

## ✅ Benefits Recap

- Instantly see successes, failures, and delays
- Reduce log fatigue during debugging
- Make logs fun and human-readable
