# Emoji Logging Example in Python

This example demonstrates a simple implementation of emoji logging in Python to illustrate the concept. The log output simulates a small deployment process with clear, expressive emoji-based feedback.

## 📜 Python Code

```python
import time

def emoji_log(message: str, emoji: str, timestamp: float):
    print(f"[{timestamp:05.2f}] {emoji} {message}")

start = time.time()

# Simulate a process with emoji-enhanced logs
emoji_log("Creating AWS Secret...", "☁️", time.time() - start)
time.sleep(1)

emoji_log("Waiting for pods to become ready...", "⏳", time.time() - start)
time.sleep(2)

emoji_log("Validating pods with AI 🧙 magic...", "🧙", time.time() - start)
time.sleep(1.5)

emoji_log("All 48 pods joined the cluster successfully!", "✅", time.time() - start)
time.sleep(0.5)

emoji_log("Deployment complete!", "🚀", time.time() - start)
```

## 🧪 Output Example

```
[00.00] ☁️ Creating AWS Secret...
[01.00] ⏳ Waiting for pods to become ready...
[03.00] 🧙 Validating pods with AI 🧙 magic...
[04.50] ✅ All 48 pods joined the cluster successfully!
[05.00] 🚀 Deployment complete!
```

## ✨ Why It Works

Emoji logging helps:
- Improve scan-ability during incident response
- Visually highlight stages of a process
- Add delight and clarity to logs (even for non-technical stakeholders)

## 🔚 Summary

This example illustrates how even simple scripts can benefit from emoji logging. Try incorporating it into your own CLI tools, deployments, or scripts to bring clarity — and a little joy — to your logs!
